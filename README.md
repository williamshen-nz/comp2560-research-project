# Intelligent Intersection Control for Platoons of Autonomous Vehicle
Research project for COMP2560 Studies in Advanced Computing R&D

## Abstract
The rise in the development of autonomous vehicles
brings interesting challenges especially in the coordination
between such vehicles. In an environment made up entirely of autonomous
vehicles, intersections should be controlled intelligently
by scheduling vehicles through the intersection to reduce delays
and improve travel times. We investigate potential algorithms
to schedule platoons (groups) of autonomous vehicles through
intersections to maximize throughput â€” thus reducing cost,
congestion, travel time and energy consumption. We approach
this as an online scheduling problem using vehicle to vehicle
communication rather than vehicle to infrastructure communication
to significantly reduce the costs of implementing, and to
increase the potential scalability of such a solution.
